2. Install dependencies from the root directory
    ```npm install```
3. build using ```npm run build```
4. run in dev mode ```npm run dev```
5. OR run the server using ```npm start```
6. to interact with the server in test mode and on stdio, you can run ```node dist/index.js``` then open another terminal and run the examples under example.txt
